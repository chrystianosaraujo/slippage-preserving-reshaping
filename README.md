## Installation
Clone this repository to get started.
```
git clone https://github.com/chrystianosaraujo/slippage-preserving-reshaping.git
```

Only Windows build is supported at the moment (specifically tested on Visual Studio 2022 [v143]). Stay tuned for updates as we add support to other platforms.

Besides the MSVC compiler, the only dependency is cmake, as our build system automatically downloads all other dependencies.

## Compilation
Use the following instructions to build in release mode.

```
cd [PROJECT_ROOT]
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

Now, either open the VS project or build it directly from command line as follows:

```
cmake --build . --config Release
```
